# Handwritten-digit-recognition

I had created a neural network from scratch earlier (https://github.com/devmehta01/Neural-Network-from-scratch). I will be using this same code to perform hand digit recognition by creating different models with different number of hidden layers and neurons.

Before training, I preformed preprocessing on the image which includes flattening and standardizing the images and one hot encoding the outputs.

I then trained 3 different models: Shallow and thin, shallow and wide, deep and wide and compared the errors produced by each of these models.
